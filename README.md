# Applied_Causality
Aspriational Abstract 

On a very high level, this is an attempt to figure out what is the recipe, if there exists any, for a subfield of Economics to succeed. More concretely, I will use an Economics citation dataset to ask a series of (causal) questions. The dataset consists of categories of a paper, author’s information, papers it cited, and paper cited it. Through analyzing the dataset, I want to be able answer questions such as “does having big names at an early stage help a subfield to increase number of papers?” “Would a subfield still exist, if a particular journal did not exist?” “For a particular subfield, Is it more important to have few dedicated researchers who publishes a lot, or many researchers who publish less frequently.”
